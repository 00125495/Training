#tuple - immutable ordered finite sequnce type
#list - mutable ordered sqence type
# Create tuple - with single element
# tuple packing, unpacking
# Accessing using indexing, negitive indexing
# slicing [start:end:step]
# update the element in tuple
# update element in sublist in tuple
# deleting the tuple
# tuple methods - index, count
# tuple membership test - in, not in 
# iterate through tuple
# list vs tuple
#   1. sysntax difference 
#   2. mutable vs immutable
#   3. dir() - list of menthods 
#   4. size comparision a.__sizeof__()
#   5. function vs method
#   6. tuples are similar to dicts without keys
#   7. Tuple can be used as key for dict where as 
#       we cannot list
#   8. hashing - tuple can be hasble whereas list cannot
